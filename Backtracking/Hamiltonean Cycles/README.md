# Hamiltonean Cycles
A **Hamiltonean Path** is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once. A **Hamiltonian cycle** (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian path that is a cycle. Determining whether such paths and cycles exist in graphs is the Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-complete.
